# Progress
This is the progress board. You can check here periodically to see which stapplets are completed and which ones are still being made. Have fun!

Note: Many of these are redirects to other applets. We are still figuring out which applets are redirects and which are actual applets.
## TL;DR
### Completed: 2/34, 5.88%
### In Progress: 1/34, 2.94%
### Not Started: 31/34, 91.18%
