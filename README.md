fstaple (**F**ree **ST**atistics **AP**p**LE**ts) is a project to create a new, free version of stapplet from scratch.

### [open fstaple](https://parabirb.github.io/fstaple)
### [progress](progress.md)

## rationale
stappplet is old (not maintained since 2018), ugly (next to no CSS), and not free software (copyrighted). however, it provides lots of functions, which makes it an irreplaceable part of the average statistics class. fstaple attempts to act as a drop-in replacement, providing just as many functions while being modern, lightweight, and simple.

### in short, our goal is to make stapplet better.

## copyright
all code provided is in the public domain. fstaple has been written from scratch to prevent copyright issues--it is not based on stapplet in any way.

## contributions
contributions are appreciated and will help grow fstaple. code is indented with 4 spaces. we use the libraries jStat and Chart.js.
